# HashCalc
This is a simple windows form application to allow the user to compare a file or generate a file hash.
Utilising MD5 or SHA algorithms a file hash is generated for each file in turn and then compared.
A message is displayed to the user if both files hashes match. 
If two files have the same content but the file name or last accessed date has changed the files will retain the same hash checksum.
